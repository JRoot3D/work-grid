## Codebase Navigation

Use **Serena MCP** for all codebase navigation tasks. Serena provides semantic, symbol-aware tools that are more efficient than raw file reads:

- `get_symbols_overview` — list classes/methods in a file without reading the full body
- `find_symbol` — locate a specific class, method, or field by name path
- `find_referencing_symbols` — find all usages of a symbol across the codebase
- `search_for_pattern` — regex search when symbol names are unknown

Prefer Serena's symbol tools over `Read`/`Grep` for source code exploration. Only fall back to file-based tools when Serena is unavailable or for non-code files (JSON configs, Markdown, etc.).
